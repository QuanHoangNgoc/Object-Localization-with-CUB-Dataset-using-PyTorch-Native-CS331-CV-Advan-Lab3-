# 🦜 Object Localization with CUB Dataset using PyTorch

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on object localization using the **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB)** dataset, a widely used benchmark for fine-grained visual recognition tasks. The goal is to develop a **PyTorch-based** solution that integrates **bounding box localization** and **classification**, leveraging a **ResNet-based** architecture with custom loss functions.

## 📂 Dataset and Preprocessing
### 🔹 Steps:
- 📥 Cloned the **CUB dataset** from Kaggle and structured it for smooth integration.
- **Preprocessing Workflow:**
  - 🗂 Loaded and merged relevant files into a **consolidated DataFrame**.
  - ⚡ Created a **custom PyTorch Dataset class** to serve data efficiently.
  - 🔄 Formatted data into `train_dataloader` and `val_dataloader` for streamlined training and validation.

## 🏗️ Model Design and Loss Functions
### 🏛 Architecture:
- 🏆 Utilizes a **ResNet18 backbone** for feature extraction.
- Splits into two **fully connected branches**:
  1. 🎯 **Bounding Box Localization**: Predicts `(x_cen, y_cen, w, h)`, normalized to `[0, 1]`.
  2. 🏷 **Classification**: Outputs class probabilities.

### ⚖️ Custom Loss Function:
- **🛠 Composite Loss:**
  - 📏 **Square-root Mean Squared Error (sqrtMSE)** for bounding box localization.
  - 📊 **Cross-Entropy (CE)** for classification.
- Inspired by **YOLOv1**, we use the square-root format for `w` and `h` to improve stability for small object predictions.
- 🔧 Both losses are weighted with scaling factors to balance localization and classification performance.

## ⚙️ Training Configuration
- 🧮 **Data Type:** `float32`, deployed on **GPU** for enhanced computation speed.
- 🚀 **Optimizer:** **Adam** for efficient gradient updates.
- 📈 **Metrics Tracked:**
  - 🔥 **Training & Validation Loss**
  - 📍 **Intersection-over-Union (IOU)** for bounding box accuracy
  - 🎯 **Classification Accuracy**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- 📏 **IOU Metric:** Assesses bounding box prediction accuracy.
- ✅ **Classification Accuracy:** Measures correctness in label predictions.

## 🏆 Experimental Results
After **30 epochs**, the model achieved:
- 📍 **Average IOU:** **92%**
- 🏷 **Classification Accuracy:** **15%**

## ⚡ Efficiency and Resource Requirements
